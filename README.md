# Predicting-and-Visualizing-User-Interaction-Patterns-Using-RL-and-D3.js
A small project that predicts and visualizes user interaction patterns using Reinforcement Learning and D3.js

### The project includes:
- A **backend** implemented in Python, where a Q-learning model is used to predict the next user interaction based on simulated behavior.
- A **frontend** built with HTML, JavaScript, and D3.js that visualizes predicted interactions in an interactive dashboard. Users can click a button to see the predicted next user action (e.g., a click, scroll, or hover).
  
### Key Features:
- **Reinforcement Learning Model**: The model uses Q-learning, a popular reinforcement learning algorithm, to predict future user interactions.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: The dashboard provides an intuitive user interface where predictions are displayed dynamically as the user interacts with the button.
- **D3.js Visualization**: D3.js is used to create rich, interactive visualizations of the predicted actions in real-time.
  
### Why This Project?
This project is an experiment to combine **machine learning** with **interactive data visualization** for practical applications in **human-computer interaction (HCI)** and **user-centered design**. It aims to help developers and UX designers better understand and predict user behavior in real-time, improving website usability and personalization.

By using **Q-learning**, the project allows for continuous improvement of predictions as it is exposed to more interaction data, leading to better prediction accuracy and more intelligent behavior modeling.

## Future Work
- **Using a large Real User Data**: Integrating **real user data** would improve the model's predictions.
  
- **Enhancing the Dashboard**: More interactivity and advanced visualizations can be added to the dashboard.
